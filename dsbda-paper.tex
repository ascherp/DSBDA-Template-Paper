\section{Introduction}




\begin{tcolorbox}[title=What is Strong and Ego-less Research?,colback=red!20]
Define good research questions and run experiments that generate scientific insights, \ie new knowledge.
Do not aim to develop a new method and compare it to weak baselines, cherry-picked datasets, and experimental conditions that favor your model.

Think about:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Baselines}: Are they strong, are they state-of-the-art?

\item \textbf{Datasets}: Are they representative / used in the community, are they recent, are they challenging?

\item \textbf{Related Work}:  Conduct a thorough research for specific papers on the specific problem addressed by the paper. It is easy to overlook papers and with that baselines, datasets, etc.\footnote{A reviewer statement on ``Missing important related works'' basically means that ``the comparison with related work could be more in-depth'' and that ``the paper overlooks some key related works in this area''. 

So the related work needs to be both, covering relevant fields but also be specific to the problem. A reviewer statement like this reflects it ``The related work contains broad descriptions of prior methods on [..]. It could be more focused on prior work relevant to the paper, like work involving the [...].''.

In case of doubt, write a more detailed related work and locate it in the appendix or supplementary material, respectively. A quite positive comment received from a reviewer was ``The supplementary material is extensive and includes: Detailed proofs [...], Implementation details [...], Additional experiments [...],  A comprehensive literature review and extended discussions on related works in [...]''. 

This makes a strong case, but only if the paper is already self-contained and the appendix is used to support the paper's claims and results. 
Note, a reviewer is not required to consider the appendix.}


\item \textbf{Tasks}: Do not consider one task only, but multiple tasks. 
For example, in NLP not only classification but also entity recognition; in Graph Representation Learning, not only vertex classification, but also graph classification/regression and link prediction.
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Have a throughline in your paper and maintain it!,colback=red!20]
    A paper must be \textbf{consistent and coherent} in what it wants to convey to the reader.
    This means that you need to define and maintain a throughline in your paper.

    Key place in the paper to check for coherence and consistency are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Title} $\rightarrow$ does it contain the key message, which is then picked up in the abstract and elaborated in the introduction, 
        \item \textbf{Abstract}, 
        \item \textbf{Introduction} $\rightarrow$ contributions list and research questions, respectively, 
        \item \textbf{Datasets} $\rightarrow$  are suitable to answer the research questions from the list in the introduction,
        \item \textbf{Procedure} $\rightarrow$ explains the steps of the experiments taken to answer the research questions, one at a time.
    \end{itemize}


    Whenever you make changes at one place, check and update the others, too!
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Instructions: Write following this structure.]

To organize the introduction, the proposed structure of Jennifer Widom should be used. 
Not using the structure may leave an introduction oftentimes meaningless, when it ends at the motivation and does not well explain the *why is it a problem* and *why is it not solved* parts.

Write explicit paragraphs for each of the questions. 
Furthermore, make sure that the introduction picks up every statement made by the abstract.
The goal of the introduction is to extend the gist provided by the abstract by giving more detail, more context, explanations, and, very important, citations to definitions, related work, and methods.

\label{sec:introduction}

\todoyellow{Note: Yellow boxes provide background information, additional notes, recommendations, etc. and can later be removed.}

\todogreen{Apply Jennifer Widom structure, which is encoded here in the yellow boxes.}

\todoyellow{What is the motivation?}

Motivate your work.

% \subsection{Problem Statement (or: Problem Formalization)}

\todoyellow{What is the problem?}

Describe in precise terms what the problem is that you address. 
This definition of the problem is used/referred to throughout the paper.

\todoyellow{Why is it a problem?}

Describe the relevancy of the problem. 

\todoyellow{Why is it not yet solved?}

Describe why are existing solutions insufficient.

% \subsection{Contribution}

\todoyellow{What is our solution approach?}

Describe the method/algorithm that you propose to solve the problem.

\todoyellow{What are the results?}

Describe key results from your experiments. 
Mention datasets, measures, and observations.
Reflect on the key insights by a brief discussion.
Make the reader interested in your paper.

\todoyellow{What are your contributions?}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Instruction: Write down your list of contributions.]
The introduction (and the structure of it) needs to match the bullet items of contributions at the end of the introduction. There is a clear disconnection and break in the paper if the introduction describes the motivation well, but the contributions list is about something else, see also comment below. 

Your contributions list is a main point of discussion. 
It has to be done well. 
\end{tcolorbox}

Below, we summarize our contributions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a bullet-itemized list of research questions that you address. 
    \item Later, each research question will then be turned into a contribution, \ie a brief answer to the question is given. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Introduction What is a contribution item and what not.]
The bullet items of contributions need to be a precise description of research questions that are phrased as how they make a contribution beyond the state of the art. 
For example, ``We compare our method X with three strong baselines A, B, and C to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nine benchmark datasets. [...].'' 
The contributions list may not be a description of implementation steps, e.g., we first pre-process data, we train the models, and we evaluate the models, etc. 

%Here is an example:

\end{tcolorbox}


% \subsection{Organization}
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
%
Below, we summarize the related works.
Section~\ref{sec:methods} provides a problem statement and introduces our models/methods.
The experimental apparatus is described in Section~\ref{sec:experimentalapparatus}.
An overview of the achieved results is reported in Section~\ref{sec:results}. 
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the results, before we conclude.



\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

When reading the related work, we aim to understand the method(s), datasets used, results of the experiments, and what the results mean, \ie how the authors argue about the results in the discussion.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Instructions]
To check the trustworthiness of results, we always perform some checks (derived from~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2204-03954v5-textclassification}).
%
Papers, where one has to tick one of the items below, do not allow for a fair comparison with the state of the art.
Reasons include that they 

\begin{itemize}
\item used different or non-standard benchmark datasets,

\item modified the datasets to use a different number of classes (\ie reducing the number of classes in the preprocessing),

\item modified the datasets to use additional information (\eg additional header metadata in the 20ng text dataset),

\item employed different train-test splits (\eg use more training samples than others), 

\item used a different, smaller number of training examples (\eg run their methods only on 5\% of the training data while using a benchmark dataset),

\item not report the train-test splits (and thus the training data used remains unclear),

\item do not report hyperparameter values (particularly the learning rate), 

\item do not report an average over multiple runs of the experiments together with the standard deviation (Avg. and SD will allow to assess the influence of random factors like the initialization of model weights),  

\item have not optimized or do not use optimal hyperparameter values (\eg the learning rate strongly influences the results as demonstrated at the examples of BERT and RoBERTa by~\citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2204-03954v5-textclassification}), 

\item do unsual preprocessing on the datasets (\eg apply preprocessing for models that do not require it like BERT, drop samples in a multi-labeling task that have $1$ label and thus modify the datasets, etc.),
%

\item are unclear about the measure(s) used (\eg, while writing ``we use the F-score'' most likely means the (harmonic) F1-score, it still does not detail if micro-averaging, macro-averaging, or samples-averaging F1 is reported),
%

or

\item it is not mentioned if the procedure applied considers training a (graph) neural network in an inductive versus transductive setting (transductive models are inherently performing better on graph tasks)
%
.


\end{itemize}

\textbf{IMPORTANT}: See also, and tead the summary of dozens of practices in machine learning that may invalidate the results of a research paper.
%
``Questionable practices in machine learning'', \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12220}

\end{tcolorbox}

The rationales for not using benchmark datasets or employing other train-test splits are not always clear.
Also, the papers often do not properly report hyperparameter values or miss reporting any other of the items above.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=As a general rule when reading related work]

Be suspicous and ask yourself: ``Can I trust their results?''
Keep in mind: A primary objective of the paper is to put their method in a good light.
\end{tcolorbox}

And an important lesson when searching for literature.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Lesson learned (once) again!]
If you search for literature and do not find anything. Likely you just did not search for the right keywords.

For example, if you search for research on ``(source) code segmentation'', you will be disappointed (or happy) not to find any.
But do not be a fool. 
There is work, it is ``text segmentation'' a classical area in natural language processing.
You just have to think about source code being an (artificial) language that any modern tool will process in the same way as a natural language.

A good hint is also if the task is visible in the community.
For text segmentation there exists its own category on Papers with Code, see \url{https://paperswithcode.com/task/text-segmentation}.
\end{tcolorbox}


Writing hint:
%
Use~\cite{Abril07}
% or~\citep{Abril07} --- some other styles support this
or~\citet{Abril07}.

But always put a tilde (\~) before the \symbol{92}cite.

\subsection{Summary/Reflection}

What do we learn from the literature concerning your work?
Where are their strengths, and where are their weaknesses?
What is different in the related work compared to the proposed approach?

\label{sec:problemstatement}

(if not done as part of the introduction)

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{tcolorbox}
[title=Assumptions: What are assumptions?]
The assumptions describe explicitly what characteristics of the dataset, method, etc. are assumed when running the experiments. What assumptions you make are as different as the research questions. An example of an assumption in graph learning is "We assume to have access to unlabeled test nodes during training, i.e., we assume a transductive graph learning setting."
\end{tcolorbox}

- What are the assumptions that you make?

Note: make sure there is an explicit section or subsection called ``Assumptions'' in your paper.

\begin{tcolorbox}
[title=Example: A textbook example of what an assumption is]
Our primary assumption [for bibliographic metadata extraction] is that all necessary information can be found within a one-hop crawl of the landing page associated with the DOI. This assumption is based on our observation that publishers present key bibliographic information on the landing page or pages directly linked to it \eg the PDF of the publication.
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}
[title=Assumptions: Difference to research questions.]
The assumptions are clearly not the same as the research questions (that are to be stated in the introduction). *Writing the research questions in the section on assumptions is not possible.* 
\end{tcolorbox}



\subsection{Methods for Aspect 1}

\todopink{Point of Discussion: Provide a bullet-itemized list of the aspects that are considered by your research.
For each aspect, provide a description of the methods/models used and proposed (own methods).
Make sure it is consistent with the research questions/contributions describe in the introduction.

\textit{Example}: Aspects are: a) clustering algorithms, b) embedding methods, c) similarity measures. Instances for a) are DBCAN, $k$-means, etc., b) TF-IDF, BERT, etc., c) cosine similarity.}

\label{sec:experimentalapparatus}

Follow the description of the experimental apparaturs given the structure below.

\todoyellow{Make sure to cover the questions provided in the EMNLP checklist, see Appendix~\ref{app:emnlp2021-checklist}.}


\subsection{Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}

\begin{tcolorbox}
    [title=Dataset: What needs to be included in the description?]
    The used datasets need to be described including a table showing relevant descriptive statistics. 
    This includes the number of samples in the data set and the split of the dataset into the train, validation, and evaluation sets. Other information relevant to the experiment needs to be included such as the total number of classes and the average number of classes per sample (in case of multi-label classification), the average length of a document, etc. Commonly this information is provided in tabular form. 
    What information is to be included depends on the research question. 
    A good guide is to look it up from closely related papers. *Independent of what is reported on the datasets, it is always necessary to add for each average also the standard deviation.* 
\end{tcolorbox}

Datasets: Which datasets do you use?
Provide descriptive statistics, usually in tabluar form.

\todopink{Point of Discussion: Make sure that your datasets fit to the problem and research questions, respectively.
Make sure that the datasets are available.
Available means that you have a) the license obtained (if needed) and b) the datasets are actually on your disk (copied).}


\subsection{Preprocessing \textit{or} Pre-processing}
\label{sec:preprocessing}

Describe the steps that are needed to prepare the datasets for the experiments.
It is commonly about rather technical steps that are important for a good reproducibility of the work.

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}

\begin{tcolorbox}
    [title=Procedure: What needs to be described to understand the experiments.]
    The experimental procedure needs to be clearly described such that one can understand precisely which experiments are carried out and how. 
    Do not mix in pre-processing (it is its own subsection above) nor implementation details (it is a subsection below). 
    Focus on describing how the experiments are used to answer your research questions. 
    So if there are three research questions in the order A, B, and C, one would expect that the procedure describes experiments corresponding to these research questions in exactly this order. 
    If not already clear from the dataset description, include a clear statement about the dataset split including a rationale why this specific split is used. 
    It can be as short as ``We use a standard train/validate/test-split of 80, 10, and 10 percent of the dataset, following the literature (cite the papers).''

\end{tcolorbox}

\todopink{Point of Discussion: Describe which methods you use along the aspects defined in your research, on which datasets they are applied, etc. Make sure it reflect fully the experiments that you want to carry out according to your own plan defined in the research questions.}

Procedure: How do you run your experiments?

\subsection{Hyperparameter Optimization}
\label{sec:hyperparameteroptimization}

\todoyellow{Note: If space is limited, this can be moved to supplementary materials}

\todopink{Point of Discussion: What are the (critical) hyperparameters that you need to consider (beyond the learning rate)? 
How do you plan to optimize the hyperparameters with respect to the models and datasets? 
What is the hyperparameter search space?}

\subsection{Measures \textit{or} Metrics}
\label{sec:measures}


Measure: How do you measure the results?

\todopink{Point of Discussion:
Regarding the measurements and what to measure, \ie to which level of detail, please carefully read:
John Ousterhout's article on ``\textit{Always Measure One Level Deeper}''~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Ousterhout18}.}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

- Report your results in tabular or otherwise structured form.

- Limit to objective results, no interpretation of results

\subsection{RQ1 Results}
\label{sec:results-rq1}

\subsection{RQ2 Results}
\label{sec:results-rq2}

\subsection{... Results}
\label{sec:results-rq...}


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

- Now interpret and reflect on your results.

\subsection{Key Scientific Insights [Gained from the Results]}
\label{sec:keyresults}

- What is the key takeaway? Reflect on the results (what have we learned from them)?

- What are the key results of your research?

- What interesting insights could you obtain?

- Break down by research question.

\subsection{Threat to Validity}
\label{sec:threattovalidity}

- Why may your results be biased/not trustworthy? And why in fact are they trustworthy! How reliable are your analyses? Meaning, critically reflect on whether there may be errors / biases in your analyses. So: What (possible) threats exist that could have made the results unreliable, AND why are these not threats?

- Trick is to write down potential threats and explain why they don't hold true here!

- How reliable are your analyses? Meaning, critically reflect on whether there may be errors / biases in your analyses.

\subsection{Generalization}
\label{sec:generalization}

- Will the results be transferable/generalize to other datasets, tasks, models, etc?

- Can one transfer the insights/results to other datasets? ... other scenarios? ... other algorithms? Why can we assume that the results generalize?

Why?

\subsection{Future Work and Impact}
\label{sec:futurework}

What is future work?

What is the general impact of your work?
--- pick up arguments from introduction etc.

[- But also: What is the practical impact. ]



\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\todoyellow{Summarize the key results in an interesting and new way.
For example by expanding it to a general broader scope of science, economics, impact to life, etc. :-)}

Provide a brief outlook to future work! (If not described in the Section~\ref{sec:futurework})


\section*{Limitations}

- Reflect on the limitations of your work, so what conclusion cannot or should not be derived from the work.

See also EMNLP's \textbf{Mandatory Discussion of Limitations}.

\begin{quote}
    We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. EMNLP 2023 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review.
\end{quote}

[...]

\begin{quote}
While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative. In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.
